Strategic Squares breathes new life into the timeless competition of Tic-Tac-Toe, presenting a classic challenge with modern twists. Designed for two players, this game expands the traditional three-by-three grid, offering dynamic gameplay, strategic depth, and multiple paths to victory. Prepare for a battle of wits, where only the most cunning can claim victory.

## Overview

- **Gameplay Essence**: At its core, Strategic Squares is the well-loved Tic-Tac-Toe, known also as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os. Two players compete to mark three consecutive spaces in a grid, aiming for horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal alignments to win.
- **Expanded Playfields**: Unlike the classic version, players can challenge each other on grids larger than the standard 3x3, escalating the strategic possibilities.
- **Draw Conditions**: It's a solved game where optimal play from both contenders results in a draw, emphasizing the need for clever tactics.

### Getting Started

- **Player Registration**: Initially, the game prompts for the names of Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Game Initiation**: Upon entering names, players hit **Start** to commence the duel. A **Rules** button is also available, offering a chance to review game mechanics and strategies.
- **Two-Player Dynamics**: Strategic Squares is exclusively a two-player experience, fostering competitive yet friendly matchups.

### In-Game Mechanics

- **Opening Board**: The game kicks off with an empty board, Player 1 making the first move with 'X', followed by Player 2 with 'O'.
- **Gameplay Flexibility**: Players can **reset** the game to its initial state or **give up** at any point. However, once the game concludes, no resets are allowed.
- **Role Reversal**: A **Switch Button** allows the second player to take the first move, adding an element of surprise and strategy adjustment.

### Conclusion of the Game

- **Victory Conditions**: A player wins by aligning three marks in a horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal row. Draws lead to a replay option.
- **Data Recording**: Post-game, the system logs the date and time of the match, player names, turn count, and winner's name.
- **Recognition**: A High Score Table showcases the top 5 players based on wins and, in case of ties, on the number of moves. This competitive feature encourages ongoing engagement.
